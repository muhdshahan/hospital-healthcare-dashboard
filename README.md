## Features
- The dashboard uses pie charts, bar charts, and donut charts to analyze patient distribution by department, age group, and treatment type.
- Filters and slicers enable users to drill into specific categories, such as gender, medical condition, or insurance type.
- Dynamic hospital performance trends and a table of top service areas provide actionable insights and easy navigation.

## Process
The data for this analysis was sourced, cleaned, and modeled in Power BI. Key fields such as patient demographics, admission type, treatment procedures, insurance coverage, and hospital departments were analyzed to identify patterns affecting hospital performance. Metrics were calculated using DAX to ensure accurate representations of healthcare service utilization. Visualizations were customized to enhance readability and user interaction.

## Dashboard Insights
- **Patient Distribution**: A significant proportion of patients are admitted through emergency services, indicating high reliance on urgent care.
- **Senior Citizen Impact**: The hospitalization rate for senior citizens is notably higher, accounting for a significant percentage of overall admissions.
- **Departmental Analysis**: Certain departments, such as cardiology and emergency, handle the most patient volume and require efficient resource allocation.
- **Revenue Breakdown**: Insurance claims contribute a significant share of hospital revenue, with private insurance providers covering the majority of treatment costs.
- **Treatment Effectiveness**: Patients undergoing scheduled procedures tend to have a higher successful discharge rate compared to emergency admissions.
